description: Draft or revise GitHub pull request titles and bodies in Japanese. Use when the user asks to create a PR, rewrite a PR body, add context from incidents or reviews, normalize multiple PRs to the same Japanese structure and tone, or add Japanese intent comments to PR diffs after opening the PR.

# Gh Pr Ja

## Overview

Use this skill when creating or editing GitHub PR titles and bodies in Japanese for engineering work. The default body structure is fixed so reviewers can scan the incident, the actual problem, the chosen approach, the PR goal, the concrete changes, and likely follow-up actions without guessing.

## When To Use

- The user asks to create a PR or rewrite an existing PR body.
- The user asks to add context such as monitoring results, Cloud Logging links, review feedback, or latest incident timestamps to a PR.
- Multiple PRs need to be aligned to the same Japanese structure and tone.
- The user wants the `Files changed` diff to explain the intent of the change with Japanese comments after the PR is opened.

## Default Body Structure

Use these sections in this order unless the user explicitly asks for a different structure:

1. `背景`
2. `問題`
3. `対策の方針`
4. `本PRのゴール`
5. `実際にやったこと`
6. `実行したコマンド`
7. `結果`
8. `Next Actionの候補`

If a section has no content, omit it. Keep `背景`, `問題`, `対策の方針`, `本PRのゴール`, and `実際にやったこと` whenever they are relevant.

## Writing Rules

- Write in Japanese plain form. Do not use polite endings such as `〜ました`, `〜です`, or `〜ます`.
- Keep bullets flat and short. One bullet should contain one point.
- In `背景`, `問題`, `対策の方針`, `実際にやったこと`, and `Next Actionの候補`, write each bullet as `- タイトル: 説明`.
- When adding comments to PR diffs, write one short Japanese comment per logical hunk so a reviewer can understand why the change exists without re-reading the whole PR body.
- Diff comments should explain intent, guardrails, or why the implementation is safe. Do not restate the code literally.
- Add diff comments only to non-obvious or reviewer-relevant changes. Skip self-evident renames, formatting-only hunks, and trivial mechanical edits.
- In `背景`, explain the trigger for the PR. If the change came from monitoring or incident investigation, include the latest confirmed timestamp with timezone and a direct link such as Cloud Logging or the alert URL when available.
- In `問題`, describe the broken behavior, missing guardrail, or operational risk. Focus on what was wrong before the change.
- In `対策の方針`, explain the design choice and the guardrails being introduced. Separate benign cases from real errors when that distinction matters.
- In `本PRのゴール`, summarize the intended reviewer-facing outcome before listing implementation details. Mention scope boundaries or non-goals when that helps avoid review confusion.
- In `実際にやったこと`, list concrete code, query, config, or test changes. Do not repeat rationale here.
- In `実行したコマンド`, list the exact verification commands and whether each succeeded.
- In `結果`, state the current state such as `成功`, remaining risk, or follow-up.
- In `Next Actionの候補`, list realistic follow-up work, rollout checks, or investigations that would naturally follow this PR when they exist.

## Workflow

1. Sync the branch with the latest base branch before opening or updating the PR:
   identify the base branch, run `git fetch origin`, and rebase or merge the working branch onto the latest `origin/<base>` using the repository's standard flow. If conflicts appear, resolve them before drafting the PR body or running `gh pr create`. If the base branch advances again while the PR is open, repeat this step before finalizing the PR.
2. Gather the evidence needed to justify the PR:
   `git diff`, tests, CI results, review comments, incident logs, monitoring links, and latest occurrence timestamps.
3. Decide the title:
   keep it short, in Japanese, and consistent with the repository's commit or PR prefix conventions such as `fix:` or `feat:` when those conventions exist.
4. Draft the body using the default section order and the titled bullet format where required.
5. Open or update the PR.
6. After the PR exists, inspect the `Files changed` tab and add Japanese comments to the important diff hunks:
   cover changes whose intent is not immediately obvious from the code, especially guard conditions, error handling, operational workarounds, schema changes, and behavior changes.
7. Remove fluff:
   do not narrate the work process; keep only reviewer-useful facts.
8. If the user asks to revise an existing PR:
   preserve the facts, but rewrite the structure and tone to match this skill.

## Diff Comment Rules

- Prefer comments on added lines or the nearest changed line in the hunk.
- Keep each comment to one to three short sentences.
- Mention the before/after behavioral difference when that helps, such as `旧実装では...` and `この変更で...`.
- If a hunk is already fully explained by the PR body and the code is obvious, do not add a redundant comment.
- If the repository or team has a stronger convention for self-comments on PRs, follow that convention.

## Example Skeleton

```md
## 背景
- 発端: Demo 環境のアラート調査で `...` が継続的に発生していた
- 最新確認: 2026年3月12日 09:40:55 JST（`...Z` / `revision-name`）
- 参照ログ: [Log Explorer](https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/query;query=...)

## 問題
- 影響: ...

## 対策の方針
- 判定基準: ...

## 本PRのゴール
- 監視で拾った既知ケースを正常系として扱い、不要な失敗通知を止める
- 本PRでは周辺バッチの再設計までは行わない

## 実際にやったこと
- API応答整理: ...
- ログ補強: ...

## 実行したコマンド
- `...` : 成功

## 結果
- 成功

## Next Actionの候補
- 本番確認: ...
- 監視調整: ...
```

## Example Diff Comments

```md
- この分岐を追加して、空レスポンスを異常系として扱わずに早期 return するようにした
- ここで request id をログに残し、Cloud Logging 上で失敗ケースを同一キーで追跡できるようにした
- リトライ回数を設定値経由に寄せて、環境ごとの差分をコード変更なしで切り替えられるようにした
```
